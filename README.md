# tacky

### Nothing special, just a kick starter, crazy Flutter APP that helps to track and reward (monetary) anyone for doing daily excercises and having food on time.
### Just a draft version (can be more generalized, just created for fun while learning Flutter, with a week of Flutter experience).
### Can add any number of entries for any given date.
### Delete functionality is however hidden with a secret that it will work only if number '1' is being entered in the input field that preceds the delete icon.
### Just created to encourage my neighbour's kid to maintain a healthy life style (so that the kid's father can reward the kid if he eats at right time and stays active, by tracking it) [lol ;)]
### Why the name 'tacky'? well that was a typo, the actual intention was 'tracky', but kept as it is (with missing 'r' in tracky) as this sounds crazy ;)
